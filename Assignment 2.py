#Question 1: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations
# x= int(input("enter the first number"))
# y=int(input("enter second number"))
# ##z= x+y
# ###print(z)
# print(x-y)
# print(x*y)
# print(x/y)
# print(x%y)
##
##Question 2: Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator.

# if x%2 == 0:
#     print("even number")
# else:
#     print("odd")
#     ##Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero.
# if x>0:
#     print(">0")
# elif x<0:
#     print("<0")
# else:
#     print("0")
# if x>=90:
#     print("A")
# elif x>=80:
#     print("B")
# elif x>=70:
#     print("c")
# else:
#     print("d")
##Question 5: Write a Python program to create a text file called sample.txt and write the sentence "Hello, this is a sample file." to the file. Then, read and display the content from the file.
# Create and write to the file
# with open('sample.txt', 'w') as file:
#     file.write("Hello, this is a sample file.")
#
# # Read and display the content of the file
# with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
#     content = file.read()
#     print(content)
##Question 6: Write a Python program that reads a text file called data.txt and counts the number of words in the file.
#
   ## print(content)
   ##Question 7: Write a Python program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
x=int(input("Enter the number:"))
for i in range(1,11):
       print(f"{x}*{i}={x*i}")
#Question 8: Write a Python program to display the multiplication table of a number entered by the user using a for loop.
